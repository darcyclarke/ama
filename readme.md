I get a lot of questions by email and can't answer them all. This is a great way for anyone to ask or read questions and answers! 

#### Anything means *anything*. Personal questions. Money. Work. Life. Code. Whatever.

### Guidelines

- Ensure your question hasn't already been answered.
- Use a succinct title and description.
- Bugs & feature requests should be opened on the relevant issue tracker.
- Support questions are better asked on Stack Overflow.
